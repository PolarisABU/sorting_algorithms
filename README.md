Resources

Read or watch:

    Sorting algorithm
    Big O notation
    Sorting algorithms animations
    15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)

GitHub

There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.
